                <h2>About the Museum</h2>
                <p> The Museum of Tomorrow is an Applied Sciences museum launched December 2015, which explores the
                    opportunities and challenges
                    which humanity will be forced to tackle in the coming decades from the perspective of sustainability
                    and conviviality. It is an experimental science museum meant to
                    explore,
                    imagine, and conceive all the possibilities for constructing the future that combines the accuracy
                    of science with the
                    expressiveness of art, using technology as a support in interactive environments and audiovisual and
                    gaming facilities created from scientific studies
                    conducted by experts and data released all over the world. </p>
                <p>Designed by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, the building - whose organic shapes were
                    inspired by the bromeliads of the Botanic Garden of the city - is a new icon of the modernization of
                    Rio de
                    Janeiro’s harbor</p>
