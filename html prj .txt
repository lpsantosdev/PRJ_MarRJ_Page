                <h2>About the Museum</h2>
                <p> The Museum of Tomorrow is an Applied Sciences museum which explores the opportunities and challenges
                    which humanity will be forced to tackle in the coming decades from the perspective of sustainability
                    and conviviality. Launched December 2015 by Rio de Janeiro City Hall, Museum of Tomorrow is a
                    Culture asset from Rio's Secretary of Culture and it is a new icon of the modernization of Rio de
                    Janeiro’s harbor, the Museum of Tomorrow was born in the Praça Mauá as a science museum meant to
                    explore,
                    imagine, and conceive all the possibilities for constructing the future. An experimental museum,
                    where the content is presented through a narrative that combines the accuracy of science with the
                    expressiveness of art, using technology as a support in interactive environments and audiovisual and
                    gaming facilities created from scientific studies
                    conducted by experts and data released all over the world.</p>
                <p>Designed by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, the building - whose organic shapes were
                    inspired by the bromeliads of the Botanic Garden of the city - occupies an area of 15 thousand
                    square meters, surrounded by reflecting pools, gardens, a bike lane, and a leisure area, all adding
                    up to 34.6 thousand square meters of the Píer Mauá.</p>
